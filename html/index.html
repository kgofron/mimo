  <p><em>Physics of Radon</em></p>
<p>Radon is about 10 times heavier than air. Thus it settles at low points of home, and below the external sufrace level. Home basements are one of the areas where it might accumulate. It can be present in some spring waters and hot springs as well. Radon (Rn) is a noble gas with 86 atomic number, and thus chemically similar to Xe/Ne/Ar/He. Rn decays fast with most stable isotope Rn-222 decaying over 3.8 days. </p>
<p>Home owners can measure the radiation level due to Rn using two portable continous monitors, which are available from Amazon at about $100. The "safe" level in US is below 4 pico-Curi/Liter. My measurements indicate that outdoor and upstairs of the house measures around 1.1 pC/L (SW of Chicago). Additionally, the basement Rn concentration is very dependent on the season, and snow melt increased it to above 11 pC/L. During dryer part of summer, the Rn level decreases significantly.  </p>
  <h2>Health risks of Radon</h2>
    <p>Radon is breathed with air into lungs, and delivers radioactive dose directly to lung inner surface. The concentrated alpha/beta radiation couses lung cancer.</p>
    <h2>Radioactivity of Radon</h2>
 <p><em>Radon decays primarly through alpha and beta decay, with He/e radiation energy absorbed in a thin layer of the lungs. The end result of decay is a stable isotope of lead Pb-206</em><p>
